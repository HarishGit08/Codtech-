Project Overview: Student Grade Tracker

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive Java application for managing and tracking student grades effectively. The application will offer tools for:

1. Data Entry: Efficiently input and store student details (e.g., names, IDs) and grades for various subjects or assessments.


2. Grade Calculation: Perform accurate computations, including averages, weighted averages, and grade point averages (GPAs).


3. Data Reporting: Generate detailed reports, such as individual student profiles, class performance summaries, and honor roll lists.


4. Data Analysis: Provide basic tools for trend analysis, identifying areas for improvement, and highlighting potential academic concerns.
